<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div id="opening" class="section">
  <h3>Opening the Database</h3>
  <p>To open the database navigate to the OpenOffice Base file named "Safai 
  Inventory Management.odb" and double click it (It is currently stored at: 
  C:\Users\safai\Desktop\Accounting Packet\Safai Inventory Management 
  Database)</p>
  <img src="./images/opening.png">
  <p>When the database opens select "Enable Macros" from the pop-up dialog</p>
  <img src="./images/enablemacros.png">
</div>

<div id="overview" class="section">
  <h3>OpenOffice Base Database Overview</h3>
  <div class="block">
    <img class="float-left" src="./images/leftinterface.png">
    <p>Along the left of the Base interface under the Database header are four
    buttons which will allow you to view different aspects of the database. Of
    primary concern are the "Forms" and the "Tables".</p>
    <p>Under "Forms" are the database forms which will be the most User-Friendly
    way for you to interact with the database.</p>
  
    <img class="float-right" src="./images/forms.png">
    <p>The <a href="#managegoodsform">Manage Goods form</a> will allow you to
    register goods from a supplier.</p>
    <p><a href="#manageingredientraws">MANAGE
    INGREDIENT RAWS form</a> is used to map a supplier invoice item (a "Good") to
    an "Ingredient" which can be used in a recipe (which can be defined using the
    <a href="#managerecipies">Manage Recipies form</a>).</p>
    <p>Finally, <a href="#manageinvoices">Manage Invoices</a> can be used to
    enter, view, and edit an invoice.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <img class="float-right" src="./images/tables.png">
    <p>Under "Tables" are the various database tables which form the core of the
    database by containing and structuring all of it's data. You'll notice two
    different images by the various items listed here. The kind next to the red
    mark is an actual table whereas the kind indicated by the green mark are
    called views.</p><p>The only table you should ever need to edit directly is the
    <a href="#supplierstable">SUPPLIERS table</a>, which will be done when you
    need to register a new vendor or supplier with the database in order to track
    their goods and invoices.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h2>Forms</h2>
<div id="manageinvoices" class="section"><h3>Manage Invoices Form</h3>
  <img src="./images/manageinvoices.png">
  <div id="supplierdropdown"><h5>Supplier dropdown</h5>
    <p>You will notice that there are two dropdown boxes on the form for
    the Supplier. The first box determines which supplier is <b>recorded in the
    database</b> for this invoice whereas the secound box is used by the form
    to properly interpret item codes. If you click the arrows on the Invoice
    Navigation Panel to flip through a few invoices you will see that the
    first box changes while the other stays the same. This is because the
    first box is reflecting what is stored in the database, but the second
    will just display whichever supplier was last selected. You will also
    see that the Item Codes and Goods Names do not appear whenever the two
    Supplier dropdown boxes do not match. To see these on any given invoice
    <b>change the second dropdown</b> to match the first and then click Save
    Invoice Header to refresh the form. Never change the first Supplier
    dropdown unless you need to actually change which supplier this invoice
    is for.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="invoiceaccountingdate"><h5>INVOICE ACCOUNTING DATE</h5>
    <p> The INVOICE ACCOUNTING DATE text box will
    determine which week and period this invoice is coded for. So if the 
    invoice you are entering is actually dated within the week and period you
    are coding it for then simply enter that date here, otherwise enter a
    date within the range of the period and week you want the invoice coded
    for. This functionality exists for cases when an older invoice was
    misplaced and but now needs to be coded within the current week.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="enteringanewinvoice"><h4>Entering a New Invoice</h4>
    <p>To enter a new invoice open the Manage Invoices form and click the New
    Invoice button. Select the Supplier Name from the first SUPPLIER dropdown
    box. (If the Supplier is not listed you will have to enter the supplier
    name into the <a href="#supplierstable">SUPPLIERS Table</a> as detailed
    in that section of the manual. Note that you will need to either close and
    reopen the form or select one of the invoice header fields and then click
    the Refresh Button located at the bottom of the form).
    Next enter the date listed on the invoice
    into the INVOICE DATE text box and the appropriate date into the <a href=
    "#invoiceaccountingdate">INVOICE ACCOUNTING DATE</a>. Now enter the
    invoice number listed on the invoice into the SUPPLIER INVOICE ID field;
    if the supplier did not provide an invoice number simply type the invoice
    date here as well. Next select the invoice type from the INVOICE TYPE
    dropdown. If it is a check please enter the check number in the CHECK
    NUMBER field. Next click the Save Invoice Header button and then select
    the supplier name from the second <a href ="#supplierdropdown">Supplier
    dropdown</a> and click the Save Invoice Header button once more.</p>

    <p>Now that the Invoice Header has been created and the supplier set for
    the form you can begin to enter the goods listed on the invoice. Enter
    the quantity and press the Enter key on your keyboard, the cursor will
    automatically move to Unit Price which you can now enter. Press the Enter
    key again and start typing in the Item Code for the current item, the
    form will begin to guess what code you are trying to enter. You can also
    click on the Item Code field or the Goods Name field to use the dropdown
    to select the good rather than typing, but for quick entry of invoices
    typing is recommended once you get a handle on using the form. When you
    select an Item Code or a Goods Name the other field will be automatically
    updated to match the entry you have selected. If the good/item code you
    are attempting to enter does not show up in the drop down then you will
    need to use the <a href="#managegoodsform">Manage Goods Form</a> in order to
    register the good in the database. (After registering a new good you will
    need to click Save Invoice Header before it will show up in the dropdown).
    Continue to enter the rest of the items on  the invoice in this same manner.</p>

    <p>When you have finished entering the line items from the invoice click
    the Save Invoice Header button to see the calculated results for the
    invoice. Verify that the calculated Invoice Totals match the totals on
    the physical invoice. If they don't, check the quantities and unit prices
    you entered. You can also refer to the calculated Ext Price and Tax to
    help find the source of the mistake. If an item is not showing a tax but
    it should be you can fix this via the Manage Goods form</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div id="managegoodsform" class="section"><h3>Manage Goods Form</h3>
  <img src="./images/managegoods.png">
  <p>The Manage Goods Form is where goods from a particular supplier are
  defined. To view, enter or edit goods for a supplier select their name
  from the drop down and click the filter button. If a supplier does not
  appear in the dropdown box you will have to enter it into the <a href="
  #supplierstable">SUPPLIERS Table</a> as detailed
  in that section of the manual. Note that you will need to either close and
  reopen the form or select the supplier dropdown and then click
  the Refresh Button located at the bottom of the form.</p>
  <p>To enter a new good, first enter its <b>Item Code</b>. This code must be unique
  amongst the Item Codes for this supplier. <b>If an item with the same number
  has already been entered the form will prevent you from moving to a new
  line on the form.</b> </p>
  <p>The <b>Tax Field</b> is used to define any taxes which should
  be applied to this good. If a good is taxed it will almost always be
  Kentucky sales tax which is entered here as 0.06 (i.e. 6%). In most cases
  you should be able to determine if an item is taxed based on the invoice
  it is found on.</p>
  <p>The <b>Description</b> field is less technical than the others but it should
  concisely identify what the good is, be easy to match up with the
  description used on the invoice itself, and start with the most
  descriptive word so that when searching through the items when sorted
  alphabetically this item will be easily found and identified.</p>
  <p>The <b>Unit Type</b> should define how much of this good is considered a single
  unit by the supplier's invoices. Sometimes this is easy to glean from the
  invoice itself but sometimes you might have to find the product itself and
  look or failing that look it up on the supplier's website.
  This field is a "soft dropdown" this means that like a regular
  drop down, as you type it will supply suggestions (or you can click to view
  them all); the difference is that if the entry you want does not come up you
  can still type whatever is approrpriate. If you define a new entry here it
  will popup in the future as a suggestion for this field. </p>
  <p>The <b>Department</b> should be one of our predefined accounting departments.
  This field--like the Unit Type--is a soft dropdown.</p>
  <p>The <b>Supplier</b> field is pre-filled and should not need to be changed
  unless you accidentally registered a good with the wrong supplier. Note that
  if you do alter this field it will disappear from this filter and appear
  under the supplier you changed it to.</p>
  <p>All remaining fields are only used for inventory and recipes and will
  be documented at a later date</p>

<h2>Tables</h2>
<div id="supplierstable" class="section"><h3>SUPPLIERS Table</h3>
  <div class="block">
    <img class="float-left" src="./images/suppliers_table.png">
    <p>The SUPPLIERS Table is the only table in the database which should need
    to be directly edited during normal operation of the software. It is also
    the most simple table in the database. The table lists the supplier's name
    and a unique identifying ID specific to our database. <b>The SUPPLIER_ID is
    provided by the table itself and you will never need to enter or modify this
    field.</b></p>
    <p>To enter a new supplier, first check that they are not alread
    registered in the database by perusing the entries already here. Once you
    are certain that they are not, scroll down to the bottom of the table. Here
    you will see an entry where instead of a number the SUPPLIER_ID is listed as
    &lt;AutoField&gt;. Click on the empty SUPPLIER_NAME field next to the
    &lt;AutoField&gt; you just identified and type the supplier's name and either
    press the enter key or click elsewhere in the table. This will save the
    entry and the &lt;AutoField&gt; indicator will be replaced with a number. That's
    it!</p>

<h2>External Files</h2>
<div id="getrecap" class="section">
  <h3>get recap by week.ods</h3>
  <img src="./images/get_recap_icon.png">
  <p>The "get recap by week.ods" file should be located in the same folder as
  the Safai Inventory Management.odb as shown above.</p>
  <p>This file is used as a template to create the invoice recaps for our
  accountant. It pulls from the database all of the invoices from a specific
  period and week and then breaks them out by Invoice Type and Accounting
  Department.</p>
  <div class="block">
    <img src="./images/get_recap.png">
    <div class="block">
      <img src="./images/get_recap_refresh.png" class="float-left">
      <p>First you must specify the Year, Period and Week which you want to see
      data for. To do this right click within the dark black border of the Pivot
      Table (pictured above and also called a Data Pilot) and the popup shown to
      the left will appear. Click "Refresh".</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      <img src="./images/get_recap_parameters.png" class="float-right">
      <p>The Parameter Input dialog will appear. It is here that you will enter
      the Week, Period, and Year and then click OK. The dialog will reappear;
      enter the same information (this is a quirk of the OpenOffice software suite)</p>
    </div>
    <img src="./images/get_recap_filter_type.png" class="float-left">
    <p>Now you can filter the results by Invoice Type. To do so click on the
    Type Filter Dropdown Box arrow (refer to the Pivot Table image above). Note:
    Be sure to click the arrow and not the text INVOICE_TYPE, this won't cause
    any serious issue but rather than opening the filter dialog it will rearrange
    the order of the various filters.</p>
    <p>The filter dialog to the left should now appear. Check the invoice
    types you want to see and click OK. (Currently we only display these one
    type at a time.)</p>
  </div>
  <p>Once you have all of the data displaying in the pivot table which you need
  you can go to the File menu and select Save As. Under the "Save as type:"
  option on the Save As dialog click the dropdown and select "Microsoft Excel
  97/2000/XP (.xls) (*.xls)" (See image below). Name the file appropriately and click Save.</p>
